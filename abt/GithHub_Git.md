# Learn Git & GitHub
Version Control, Collaboration, and Code Management with Git & GitHub, If you don't know what these things are, this is the perfect opportunity to learn!

## Overview
Version control is a software development practice that tracks and manages changes to code and other files. Basically it helps you keep a track of any software that you are developing, you can make versions of code, test them before deploying and if due to any reasons your software fails you will always have a previous version to get back to.

Version control makes it easier for you to collaborate and manage your code. And that's where Git and GitHub comes into picture. 

### What is Git?
Git is a free, open-source version control system that's used to keep track of changes in your project. So git helps you in maintaining and managing code but how?

### How does Git Helps?

- **Tracking:** Git records who made what changes and when, allowing you to track the history of your project and easily revert to previous versions if needed.

- **Branching and Merging:** You can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Once the changes are tested, you can merge them into the main branch.

- **Collaboration:** Git enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. Developers can push their changes to a shared repository, and Git handles merging, helping resolve any conflicts that arise when changes overlap.


- **Backup:** By pushing your code to remote repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), you ensure your work is backed up and accessible from anywhere.

- **Code Review and Collaboration Tools:** Through pull requests (PRs), you can review and discuss code before merging it, ensuring quality control.

### What is GitHub?

You now understand what is git and how does it help and how important it is. Now, let's understand GitHub, it is a web-based platform that allows users to collaborate on code, web pages, and other content. 

If Git is a video then we can say GitHub is youtube. GitHub allows software developers and engineers to create remote, public-facing repositories on the cloud for free. A repository, or "repo" for short, is a coding project’s files and the revision history for each file.

## Learning Git and GitHub 

Hacktoberfest 2024 gives you the perfect opportunity to learn Git & GitHub. Hacktoberfest is a celebration of open-source contributions, they are giving you a very cool badge for your contribution and as you contribute more to it you unlock levels of customization for your badge, which you can show off in your GitHub profile and LinkedIn. 

### What you will have to learn before contributing?

- Basic git commands such as 
```bash 
git clone <repository-url>
git add <file-name>
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git branch            # Lists all branches
git branch <branch-name>  # Creates a new branch
git branch -d <branch-name>  # Deletes a branch
git push origin <branch-name>
git pull origin <branch-name>
```
- Writing appropriate commit message and creating good pull requests
- Preventing merge conflicts, always synchronize your branch with the main branch before committing.


## Conclusion

Learning Git and GitHub is crucial for version control, collaboration, and managing code efficiently. With the basics covered, you’re ready to start exploring how these tools help you track changes, avoid conflicts, and work seamlessly with others. Hacktoberfest 2024 is the perfect chance to practice these skills, contribute to open-source projects, and earn a cool badge for your efforts. Dive in, start contributing, and make the most of this opportunity to learn and grow as a developer!
